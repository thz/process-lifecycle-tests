zombie.c - simple zombie creation

subreaper.c - shows the linux feature of prctl/PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER
excerpt from PRCTL(2):
       PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER (since Linux 3.4)
              If  arg2  is nonzero, set the "child subreaper" attribute of the
              calling process; if arg2 is zero, unset the attribute.   When  a
              process is marked as a child subreaper, all of the children that
              it creates, and their descendants, will be marked  as  having  a
              subreaper.   In effect, a subreaper fulfills the role of init(1)
              for its descendant processes.  Upon  termination  of  a  process
              that  is orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent has already termi-
              nated) and marked as having a subreaper, the nearest still  liv-
              ing ancestor subreaper will receive a SIGCHLD signal and be able
              to wait(2) on the process to discover its termination status.
